    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">I. SHOP & SHIP FOR ME</h3>
    <p>At Shpper, we are redefining the way people shop internationally. We offer a pioneering peer-to-peer platform called ‘Shop & Ship for Me’ (“Platform”) that connects individuals seeking to purchase items from various locations worldwide ("Customers") with international travelers or local personal shoppers who can buy and arrange the delivery of these items ("<strong> Travelers </strong>").</p>
    <p>Travelers on the Platform act as personal shoppers, and offer their services to purchase and deliver items as requested by Customers. Customers can select a Traveler who best fits their purchase requests, delivery timeline, and budget, making international shopping more accessible and personalized.</p>
    
    <h4 class="font-bold">Obligations and Undertakings</h4>

      <li>Accept that any disputes must be resolved directly between you and the Customer or any third party;</li>
      <li>Accept that by virtue of this Agreement, you have authorized us to act on certain matters relating to disputes between you and the Customer, and if any such acts are made by us in good faith, for instance whether to release or retain the item, the same shall be binding and will not give rise to any claims from you against Shpper;</li>
      <li>Agree and authorize Shpper to contact you via various communication channels (including but not limited to SMS, calls, emails, WhatsApp, app notifications, etc.) using the contact information provided by you, with regard to the transactions made on Shpper;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>If you are a <strong>Customer</strong>, you must:</p>

      <li>Be legally permitted to purchase the item;</li>
      <li>Not place any Order requests for items in the Prohibited Items List;</li>
      <li>Use your own funds for paying for the Order but agree that ownership of the requested items being purchased for you will only pass to you upon handover;</li>
      <li>Affirm that the purchase is for personal use, not commercial purposes;</li>
      <li>Ensure the accuracy of your contact information, address details, and payment information;</li>

      <li>Accept that by virtue of this Agreement, you have authorized us to act on certain matters relating to disputes between you and the Traveler, and if any such acts are made by us in good faith, for instance regarding cancellations and refunds, the same shall be binding upon you and will not give rise to any claims from you against Shpper;</li>
      <li>Conduct all transactions lawfully and in good faith.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The responsibility for the quality of the services requested using the Platform lies with the service provider, i.e., the Traveler or personal shopper who ultimately provides the service to the Customer. Under no circumstances does Shpper accept any liability relating to or arising out of the services provided by the Traveler, nor does it accept liability for any acts, actions, conduct, negligence, or all of the foregoing, on the part of the Traveler. Any complaints about the services provided by the Traveler should be made to the Traveler. However, in certain cases, at Shpper’s sole and absolute discretion, Shpper may initiate investigations involving both parties, as necessary, and you authorize us to conduct such investigations. You also agree that the outcomes of these investigations will be binding upon you and will not result in any claims against Shpper.</p>
    
    <h4 class="font-bold">Ordering on the Shpper Platform:</h4>
    <p>To place an Order, the Customer must submit a request for an item on the Platform, providing all relevant and accurate details about the item, such as location, photos, website link, brand, color, size, price, etc. Shpper reserves the right to decline any request for items that may no longer be available, are included on the Prohibited Items List, or have been rejected by the Travelers.</p>
    <p>
    Shpper will connect Customers with Travelers, who  will have the opportunity to submit offers to the Customer. The Traveler, while submitting their offer, shall specify the purchase price of the item and the Traveler’s personal shopping fee   /commission. The Customer shall be able to see a full breakdown of the Final Price (defined hereinabove) and can review the offers, chat with the relevant Travelers on the Platform, and accordingly choose a suitable offer . Upon selection and acceptance of an offer by the Customer, a binding agreement is formed between the Customer and the Traveler and the Order is created  (“Order”). The Customer is obliged to make advance payment, through their Digital Wallet, of the Full Price     for the Order (which will be displayed on the Platform) immediately after the offer is accepted and the Order is confirmed. If payment is made after the Traveler's trip has already begun, the Traveler may be unable to purchase the item as requested. Shpper cannot guarantee the same offer will be available, whether from the same Traveler or a different Traveler, if payment is delayed. The Customer is solely responsible for any consequences arising from non-payment or delayed payment for the Order(s). 
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to safeguard the Customer’s transaction, the Customer shall remit payment directly to Shpper, who the Customer hereby authorizes to hold such funds on the Customer’s behalf. The Traveler, operating independently, will use their own funds to purchase the items and such items shall be regarded as the Traveler’s personal property. Upon the handover of the items by the Traveler to Shpper, the Traveler is engaging in a resale of their personal property to the Customer, facilitated through a peer-to-peer transaction mechanism provided by Shpper. Shpper, acting solely as an intermediary and facilitatory platform without participating in any sale or resale action, will release such funds (minus Shpper’s fees and any applicable charges, as is hereby agreed by the Traveler) to the Traveler on the Customer’s behalf, thereby effectuating the transfer of ownership of the items from the Traveler  to the Customer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The Traveler agrees that Shpper shall charge a fee based on the Traveler’s commission for providing such services on the Platform. Such fee will be displayed to the Traveler on the Platform and may be revised at Shpper's sole discretion, from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>Shpper will provide the last-mile delivery  of the item to the Customer, unless specifically agreed otherwise by all parties with Shpper's permission. These delivery charges must be paid in advance, and will be displayed on the Platform at the time of placing the Order. We endeavour to dispatch  the item to the Customer within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving the item from the Traveler. Once dispatched, the expected delivery timeframe shall be within forty-eight (48) hours for addresses within the UAE, and up to ten (10) business days for addresses outside the UAE. Shpper shall not be liable if the Customer is unreachable despite attempts made using the contact information they have provided. Shpper is not responsible for any delays or losses resulting from circumstances beyond its control, including those caused by third parties, such as delivery providers or other external factors.</p>
    <p>
    Shpper  reserves the right, but is not obligated, to conduct a preliminary inspection of shipment upon receipt from the Traveler to confirm that it does not contain any items from the Prohibited  Items List and to match the Order details; however, Shpper will not be liable for any failure to identify items that are prohibited or illegal in the transaction country. Moreover, Shpper does not verify the quality, authenticity, or suitability of the items  . If Shpper, at its sole discretion, decides that the item violates the Prohibited Items List, or any other provision of this Agreement or the Laws, Shpper reserves the right to return the item back to the Traveler at the Traveler’s cost, with no payment obligations accruing towards the Traveler. Certain items may be delivered directly to the Customer without passing through us or undergoing inspection, including in jurisdictions where we do not have operational presence, and Shpper disclaims any liability for issues arising from such deliveries.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Customer has a 24-hour window after receiving the item to inspect it and raise a valid claim against the item, if any, along with requisite evidence. The Customer and the Traveler agree to authorize Shpper to provide a resolution in good faith and agree that the same shall be binding upon them, which may include providing a refund to the Customer in their Digital Wallet, and return of the item to the Traveler.  Upon expiry of this 24-hour window without any valid claims being raised by the Customer, the payment shall be released to the Traveler (minus any applicable fees and charges) and the transaction will be deemed consummated, with Shpper’s role effectively coming to an end . Any new or further claims or investigations following the expiration of this time period shall be considered only at Shpper’s sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Traveler is obligated to attach and submit the original payment receipt as proof of purchase along with any additional invoices that were required to be paid by the Traveler in relation to the purchased item, before or at the same time as handing over the item to Shpper. Once the item has been handed over to Shpper, the Traveler cannot raise any new or further claims regarding any additional amounts to be paid by the Customer. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, if Shpper makes a payment to the Traveler for a claim it deems legitimate, both parties agree to authorize this action, and the Customer will not dispute Shpper’s bonafide decision in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Customer is obligated to pay the Full Price for the item, including any unforeseen but legitimate charges associated with it. Non-payment of the Full Price will be treated as a debt owed by the Customer and may be grounds for legal proceedings. The Customer will be liable for non-payment of any outstanding dues. Shpper reserves the right to take action, including suspending or terminating the Customer’s Account in cases of non-payment of the Full Price or any part of it. Any such suspension will remain in effect until all outstanding dues are fully settled. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Tipping and Taxation: </strong> Buyers may choose to tip Travelers as a gesture of appreciation for their services. Tips are entirely voluntary and should not be solicited in a coercive manner by Travelers. Shpper does not withhold taxes on these amounts and assumes no responsibility for any tax obligations arising from payment of tips. By accepting tips, Travelers acknowledge their responsibility to comply with all applicable Laws, including reporting and paying any applicable taxes.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold">Cancellation</h4>
    <p>A cancellation request for an Order may only be placed before or within 2 hours    of the Traveler’s trip commencing (as indicated by the deadline displayed on the Portal) , subject to the Traveler not having already made any arrangements for procurement of the item, for example, in a situation where a customized item has already been ordered in advance based on the Customer's confirmation. The Customer agrees that a cancellation after this stage may result in forfeiture of the payment amount.</p>
    <p>
    If after placing the Order, an item becomes unavailable or the procurement of the item is substantially delayed due to circumstances beyond the Traveler’s control, the Traveler must promptly notify the Customer to discuss and resolve the situation amicably. If no resolution is reached, either party may request Shpper’s assistance, with the Traveler providing relevant proof of the item’s unavailability or the reason for the substantial delay. You can contact us at info@shpper.net to discuss the possibility of cancelling your Order. We will conduct an assessment of the circumstances causing the delay, the expected time to resolve any issues, and the availability of alternative solutions. Based on this evaluation, a refund may be issued if deemed appropriate  . Refunds will be deposited into the Digital Wallet by default, whereafter Customers can request a refund to the 
    </p>

    <p>
    original payment source, which may take up to seven (7) days, depending on various factors, including bank and payment gateway processing times. The parties authorize Shpper to take any resolution in this regard and agree to accept Shpper's bonafide decision as final and binding upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
    If there is a delay, and the Traveler remains unreachable for over 24 hours despite Shpper's attempts to make contact, it may be deemed as a cancellation of the Order, and no payment obligations will be due to the Traveler.
    </p>

    <p>
    Customers are obliged to provide accurate or reasonably estimated prices when requesting an item. If the exact price is unknown, an approximate price can be entered. The Traveler may request additional payment later if the actual cost exceeds the price provided by the Customer. If the actual purchase price is significantly  higher than anticipated, the Traveler may contact the Customer prior to making the purchase, and the Customer may request   the Traveler to cancel the Order. However, if the price difference is within 15% of the original estimate, the Customer agrees that the Traveler may proceed without prior confirmation. In cases where costs such as customs charges arise, the Customer agrees to pre-authorize their payment card for such charges. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note that Shpper may apply cancellation charges in certain circumstances.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">II. MARKETPLACE</h3>
    <p>
    Shpper also offers a marketplace for within the local UAE market   or any region where Shpper legally operates (“<strong>Marketplace</strong>”) which enables individuals who wish to sell items (“Sellers”) to advertise such items (“<strong>Listings </strong>”) on the marketplace, and connects them with potential buyers (“<strong>Buyers</strong>”) who can browse these Listings and directly contact the Sellers to make offers. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-bold">Obligations and Undertakings</h4>
 <p>If you are a <strong>Seller</strong>, you must:</p>
    <ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
      <li>Use the Marketplace only if you are lawfully residing in a jurisdiction where we legally operate.

  <li>Not post any offensive, restricted, or illegal content within your Listing;</li>
  <li>Not use the Marketplace as an intermediary to post Listings on behalf of others;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>If you are a <strong>Buyer</strong>, you must:</p>
    <ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
       <li>Be legally permitted to purchase the item through the Marketplace;</li>
  <li>Carefully review Listings and ensure the item meets your requirements before placing an order to purchase the same;</li>
  <li>Ensure the accuracy of your contact information, address details, and payment information;</li>
  <li>Promptly fulfill any agreed-upon payment terms;</li>
  <li>Conduct all transactions lawfully and in good faith.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
    You acknowledge and agree that Shpper is not obligated to monitor, approve, or moderate Listings or their content on the Marketplace. We do not take responsibility for the Listings posted by Sellers; however, we reserve the right to monitor and remove any Listing that, in our sole discretion, violates these Terms of Service (including the Prohibited Items List), or Shpper’s policies, without notice. When purchasing an item via the Marketplace, you are buying directly from the Seller who posted the Listing, and Shpper is not involved, except where delivery is selected, in which case Shpper’s role is limited solely to delivering the item to the Buyer.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold">Ordering on Marketplace:</h4>
    <p>To place an order, you must add items to your shopping cart, proceed to check-out, enter your billing/shipping address, choose your preferred payment method and effect payment to complete your order . All orders are subject to acceptance and availability , and items in your shopping cart are not reserved and may be purchased by other users. We disclaim any liability for non-availability of items. If sellers cancel orders at their discretion, we are not liable for ensuring the originally listed price.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, Buyers can opt for delivery provided by Shpper, if required, for which additional charges will apply. Such additional delivery charges will be displayed to the Buyer at the time of placing the order and need to be paid in advance  . Shpper reserves the right, but is not obligated, to conduct an inspection of the shipment from the Seller. We endeavour to dispatch  the item to the Customer within seventy-two (72) hours of collecting the item from the Seller  . Once dispatched, the expected delivery timeframe shall be within forty-eight (48) hours for addresses within the UAE, and up to ten (10) business days for addresses outside the UAE. Shpper shall not be liable if the Customer is unreachable despite attempts made using the contact information they have provided. In all cases, Buyers must confirm the delivery of the item once received.</p>
    <p>
    The Seller shall determine its own sale policy  with regard to returns, refunds, etc., provided that these policies do not contravene Shpper’s policies or any Laws or the jurisdiction where any part of the transaction occurs (including but not limited to consumer protection laws). Any complaints regarding the items shall be strictly between the Buyer and the Seller as Shpper’s role would only be limited to delivery of the item, if requested.
    </p>

    <p>
    Shpper shall charge a fee to the Seller for publishing a Listing on the Marketplace. Any such fee paid by the Seller is non-refundable in all circumstances, including if the Listing is removed by Shpper for breaching or violating these Terms of Service. Payment of a Listing fee does not guarantee that your Listing will successfully lead to an order being placed or result in any minimum number of leads for your Listing.
    </p>
